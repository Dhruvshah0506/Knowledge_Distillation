## 1. Knowledge Distillation Overview

### 1.1 Theoretical Foundation

Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique where a smaller "student" model learns to mimic the behavior of a larger "teacher" model. This approach was first introduced by Hinton et al. (2015) and has become a cornerstone technique in neural network compression.

**Key Components:**
- **Teacher Model**: Large, pre-trained GPT-2 model with superior performance
- **Student Model**: Smaller DistilGPT-2 model with reduced parameters
- **Soft Targets**: Probability distributions from teacher model providing richer learning signals
- **Temperature Scaling**: Softening probability distributions for better knowledge transfer

### 1.2 Mathematical Framework

The distillation loss combines two components:

```
L_total = α × L_CE + β × L_KL
```

Where:
- **L_CE**: Cross-entropy loss between student predictions and ground truth
- **L_KL**: Kullback-Leibler divergence between teacher and student distributions
- **α, β**: Weighting coefficients for loss components
- **T**: Temperature parameter for softmax scaling

## 3. Dataset and Preprocessing

### 3.1 Dataset Structure

The implementation uses a question-answering dataset stored in `final_qa.csv` with the following structure:

```
Columns: ['question', 'answer']
Format: CSV with header
Split Ratio: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test
```

### 3.2 Data Processing Pipeline

**Prompt Engineering:**
```python
def make_qa_prompt(row):
    return f"Question: {row['question']}\nAnswer:"
```

**Tokenization Process:**
- **Tokenizer**: GPT-2 tokenizer with EOS padding
- **Max Length**: 512 tokens

**Key Innovation**: The implementation uses answer masking to compute loss exclusively on answer tokens, preventing the model from being penalized for prompt tokens during training.

## 4. Training Methodology

- **Top-p Sampling**: p=0.95 (nucleus sampling)

## 6. Technical Implementation Details

### 6.1 Loss Computation Architecture

**Answer-Focused Training:**
The implementation employs sophisticated masking to ensure loss computation occurs only on answer tokens:

```python
# Create answer mask: 0 for prompt tokens, 1 for answer tokens
answer_mask = torch.zeros(512, dtype=torch.long)
answer_mask[prompt_length:] = 1

# Apply mask to loss computation
active_loss = answer_mask.view(-1) == 1
loss_ce = F.cross_entropy(logits_flat[active_loss], labels_flat[active_loss])
```

**KL Divergence on Full Sequence:**
While cross-entropy focuses on answers, KL divergence is computed on all tokens to transfer complete contextual understanding:

```python
loss_kl = F.kl_div(
    input=student_log_probs_flat,
    target=teacher_probs_flat,
    reduction='batchmean'
) * (temperature ** 2)
```
